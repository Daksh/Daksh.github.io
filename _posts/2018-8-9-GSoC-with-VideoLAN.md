<img align="right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/vlc_logo.png" width="30%" height="30%">
Earlier this summer I got selected in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) to work with [VideoLAN](https://www.videolan.org/index.html) on the Project [VLC macOS Interface Redesign](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5721689099337728) It has been a blessing to get a chance to work on one of the highest impact open source projects. I had a phenomenal experience, lets see all the parts that I worked on...

You can have a look at my [GSoC Project Page]() and [Proposal]()

## Our Team
* [Jean-Baptiste Kempf](https://code.videolan.org/jbk) (President of VideoLAN)
* [Felix Paul KÃ¼hne](https://code.videolan.org/fkuehne) (Mentor)
* [David Fuhrmann](https://code.videolan.org/dfuhrmann) (Mentor)
* [Vibhoothi](https://code.videolan.org/vibhoothiiaanand) (Student, Amrita University)
* [Daksh Shah](https://code.videolan.org/Daksh) (Me)


## Workflow
Let's start by looking at our workflow. VLC has a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/videolan/vlc) which is read-only.  We use our [mailing list](https://wiki.videolan.org/Sending_Patches_VLC/) to send Patches. For my GSoC project, my mentors created a clone of upstream at the beginning of our coding period. It helped to keep things organized and eased the process of reviewing. You can find the repository we worked on during the summer at [https://code.videolan.org/GSoC2018/macOS/vlc](https://code.videolan.org/GSoC2018/macOS/vlc)
