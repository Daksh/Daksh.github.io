title: How to perform a Man-in-the-middle, to analyze the data transmission from your phone
---

We will use [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/), the trial version and route the network data from phone through this software.

To analyze just HTTP traffic, a non-rooted phone works. In case you wish to analyze the encrypted (HTTPS) traffic, we would need a rooted phone.

## Install softwares on laptop

1. <https://www.charlesproxy.com/download/>. We will use the unpaid version, which has limited session size of 30 minutes.
2. [for HTTPS data] Install `brew` if you do not already have it; <https://brew.sh/> (just run `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"` in Terminal)
3. [for HTTPS data] `brew cask install android-platform-tools` (for macOS), in order to install `adb`
4. [for HTTPS data] `brew install apktool` (for decompile-recompile)


## Configure Proxy Settings on android

1. Go to settings
2. Tap `Wi-Fi`
3. (for Redmi's OS), click on the arrow button next to the connected Wireless
4. Scroll down to `Proxy` and tap `Manual`
5. Fill in the `IP Address` in Hostname, and Port Number in `Port`. 
6. NOTE: Press `alt` and click on the wireless Icon, to know your laptop's IP address (in macOS). You can find required port number in Charles App. In menu bar, **Proxy > Proxy Settings**. 
If you are unable to find IP and port number, see: <https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/Tealium-for-Android/Setting-up-Charles-to-Proxy-your-Android-Device/ta-p/5121#configure_charles>

# Intercept SSL/HTTPS data

## Setting Charles to use SSL Proxying on all locations
Go to **Proxy > SSL Proxying Settings**, and add `*.*`. For more details, see: <https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/Tealium-for-Android/Setting-up-Charles-to-Proxy-your-Android-Device/ta-p/5121#configure_charles>

## Rooting your android phone

NOTE: Do it only if you are okay, if your phone gets bricked (the OS can get corrupted), and you will need to spend some time to fix it. I do not take ANY Responsibility, to what these steps might result it. This is just a summarization of the different blogs/websites that I had to follow, to achieve the results I needed.

I used a Redmi Note 4 for this task. [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRC-J-cLlE) describing the process

1. Unlock the bootloader. ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFCig10fW9E) video)
	1. Make sure you have an account signed in with MIUI (**Settings > Mi Account**)
	2. Enable Developer options **Settings > About phone > MIUI version**, tap on **MIUI version** for 7-10 times continously, which will give you a pop up saying that developer options are now enabled
	3. **Settings > Additional settings (under SYSTEM SETTINGS category) > Developer options > OEM unlocking** 
	4. Go to <https://en.miui.com/unlock/>, and click on `Unlock Now`. 
	5. It leads to <https://en.miui.com/unlock/download_en.html>, from where you can install a `zip` containing Mi Unlock app (needs to be run on a Windows machine), which is used to unlock bootloader. Sign in to your MI Account in this app
	6. Shut down your phone manually, and hold Volume down key and Power button to enter Fastboot mode
	7. Connect your phone to PC using USB cable and click "Unlock".
	NOTE: A lot of blogs/websites mention that you need to fill up a form and wait for your request to be approved, but in my case I did not get any such thing and my bootloader was unlocked immediately (it might be the case that they have removed the review process now)
2. Put the required files on your phone (I used the links provided in youtube video): [Super SU](https://download.chainfire.eu/1220/SuperSU/SR5-SuperSU-v2.82-SR5-20171001224502.zip), [Lazy Flasher](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByWEieei-0nyMTR4R0dxWk9BTms/view) 
3. Put phone in Fastboot mode. Switch off your phone, and power on by keeping **Power button + Volume Down button** pressed, and connect the phone to your mac
4. Ensure `fastboot devices` list an entry 
5. Flash TWRP Recovery. In my case, for Redmi Note 4; I downloaded <https://mirrors.c0urier.net/android/Dadi11/RedWolf/mido/RedWolf-027-mido.img>, from <https://forum.xda-developers.com/redmi-note-4/xiaomi-redmi-note-4-snapdragon-roms-kernels-recoveries--other-development/recovery-red-wolf-recovery-project-t3653704>. `fastboot flash recovery <recovery-img-path>`
6. Restart phone with **Power button + Volume Up button**
7. Install `Super SU` zip using TWRP
8. Install `Lazy Flasher` using TWRP
9. Reboot your phone
10. Your phone should be rooted now! Now you can do `adb shell` and `su`, to access all the files on your phone through ADB, and much more!

## Installing the certificate as root (requires rooted phone)

1. Download the certificate, by visiting `chls.pro/ssl` (needs Charles to be running and wireless proxy set up on phone)
2. Install <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.jolivier.cert.Importer> android app
3. Add the certificate using the app


## You have two options now

### Xposed Framework

You can install the [Xposed Framework](https://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer). There is a Youtube Video which describes this complete procress: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJRlMmJjrhY>

1. Download the framework
	1. <https://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer>, which links to 
	2. <http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3034811> (for Android 5 or higher), which links to
	3. <https://dl-xda.xposed.info/framework/>, choose the SDK corresponding to your android version. You can check this on <https://source.android.com/setup/start/build-numbers> (API Level number corresponding to your android version). In my case, it was SDK 24, corresponding to Android 7.0, which links to
	4. <https://dl-xda.xposed.info/framework/sdk24/>, searching on google for the phone architecture lead me to [a post](https://forum.xda-developers.com/redmi-note-4/xiaomi-redmi-note-4-snapdragon-roms-kernels-recoveries--other-development/rom-lineageos-14-0-t3566095/page32) on xda-developers forum, which suggested that Redmi Note 4, has `arm64` architecture, which links to
	5. <https://dl-xda.xposed.info/framework/sdk24/arm64/>, download the latest version 
	6. which in my case, is <https://dl-xda.xposed.info/framework/sdk24/arm64/xposed-v89-sdk24-arm64.zip>
2. Transfer this zip to your phone
3. Reboot phone in recovery mode, and install this zip, using TWRP (or similar)
4. Now you need to install SSL Unpinning module for Xposed Framework. (<https://repo.xposed.info/module/mobi.acpm.sslunpinning> which links to, <https://dl-xda.xposed.info/modules/mobi.acpm.sslunpinning_v2_37f44f.apk>).
5. Install the downloaded APK
6. Open Xposed Framework app, and select `Modules` from the left side bar. (Your phone might need a restart for this module to appear)
7. Enable (tick) SSL Unpinning module, and restart your phone
8. Open the SSL Unpinning app, and click on a listed app, to unpin SSL certificate for it.
9. Now you should be able to view the app's encrypted data (in unencrypted form) in Charles. Though this method might not work for some applications.


### Recompile the APK

Decompile APK, add some parameters, recompile and install the APK. [Blog](https://medium.com/@ferrygunawan/debug-ssl-traffic-with-charles-proxy-872aedb228d) describes the process in a detailed manner, I am adding the problems+solutions I had to use on top of what is mentioned there.
1. Get the installed apk from your Android device
	1. `adb devices` ensure that your device shows up (try other USB ports if the phone does not show up)
	2. `adb shell pm list packages -f app-name` to get the path of the application
	3. You essentially need to run `adb pull /data/app/bazingaa.nusbuses-1/base.apk` (replacing your app name instead), but this did not work for me, as the directory `/data/app/bazingaa.nusbuses-1/base.apk` is only allowed access for root user. To overcome this, I used a process described at: <https://android.stackexchange.com/a/129665/246838>
	4. `adb shell`
	5. `su`
	6. `cp /data/path/of/file/copyme /data/local/tmp`
	7. `chown shell.shell /data/local/tmp/copyme`
	8. `exit`
	9. `exit`
	10. `adb pull /data/local/tmp/copyme /destination/copyme`

2. Decompile the APK, with command `apktool d -f base.apk` (rename your APK to `base.apk`)
3. `android:networkSecurityConfig=”@xml/network_security_config”` and `android:debuggable="true"` need to be added under `application` tag in `AndroidManifest.xml` file. (for more details check <https://medium.com/@ferrygunawan/debug-ssl-traffic-with-charles-proxy-872aedb228d>)
4. Add/Modify `res/xml/network_security_config.xml`, with content:
	```
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<network-security-config>
	    <debug-overrides>
	        <trust-anchors>
	            <!-- Trust user added CAs while debuggable only -->
	            <certificates src="user" />
	        </trust-anchors>
	    </debug-overrides>
	</network-security-config>
	```
5. Rebuild the APK `apktool b base`
6. If there is no error, you will get the `base.apk` under `base/dist` directory.
7. You would need to sign the APK ([reference](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46411055/2806163))
	1. `keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -validity 10000`
	2. Run `jarsigner -verbose -keystore my-release-key.keystore <your-app-file> alias_name` after replacing `<your-app-file>` with your file name, eg. `jarsigner --verbose --keystore my-release-key.keystore base.apk alias_name`
	NOTE: You may change `alias_name` and `my-release-key.keystore`, if you wish; but you need to keep it consistent across the two commands
8. Uninstall the original app from your phone
9. Install signed-APK that you created, using `adb install base-signed.apk`. You might need to enable apps to be installed via USB, under Developer options.


## Extra; to look at the data that the app is storing locally

[Ref](https://android.stackexchange.com/a/47951/246838)

1. `adb shell`
2. `su`
3. `cd /data/data/`
4. `ls`, will show a list of all the app folders
5. `cd <appropriate-folder-name>`, for example: `cd com.android.bluetooth`. This will take you inside the directory used to store all the app data and you can explore here, to find what you are looking for.

If you wish to copy this on your local system (for ease of viewing), you can use `adb pull`. For me, it did not let me directly pull the folder, as it requires `su` to view it. As a workaround, you can:
